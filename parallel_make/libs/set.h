/**
* In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store
* certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values.
* It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set.
* Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element
* from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.
*
* Some set data structures are designed for static or frozen sets that do not
* change after they are constructed. Static sets allow only query operations on
* their elements â€” such as checking whether a given value is in the set,
* or enumerating the values in some arbitrary order.
* Other variants, called dynamic or mutable sets, allow also the insertion
* and deletion of elements from the set.
*
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)
*
* This set implementation also features an internal doubly linked list
* that runs from the oldest inserted element to the newest inserted element.
* Therefore, iteration through the set will always return elements in a FIFO
* pattern (removing an element and reinserting it will put it at the back
* of the queue).

/**
 * Allocate and return a pointer to a new set (on the heap).
 *
 * All parameters are optional.
 *
 * If you would like to make the set store  'shallow' copies of the elements
 * inserted thereinto, then you may pass in NULL for the parameters (or use
 * shallow_set_create()).
 *
 * (ex. set_create(hash_function, comp, NULL, NULL)).
 *
 * This means that every time an element is to be copied or removed from the
 * set, the pointer to that element is copied or removed instead of using
 * a user supplied copy constructor and destructor.
 *
 * If you supply NULL for the hash_function, then all elements will hash to the
 * same index, causing all operations to require a linear scan of the set.
 *
 * If you supply NULL for the compare then elements will be compared by their
 * virtual address.
 *
 * WARNING: The hash function and comparator need to be consistent. i.e.
 * if two elements compare as equal, then they MUST have the same hash;
 * otherwise, accessing this set will result in undefined behavior.
